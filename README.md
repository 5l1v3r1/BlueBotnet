# Blue Botnet 

While looking for malware samples on urlhaus, I came across this. I started reversing it to see if it was anything interesting. It really isn't, however it did make me laugh however. So in the orginal sample the skid tries getting the botnet to connect to localhost (btw the cnc is still up and running). Its always funny finding these samples. I've got zero use for this at all so I thought I'd post it on my github for educational purposes.

### Installing
Install visual studio and git clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/backslash/BlueBotnet/
```
Open up the .sln file and just compile it, easy as that.

## Contributing

## Thanks to BlasphemiumThe3rd
While searching to see if any other researchers had published this, I found the blue bot panel and the builder. I stuck in the panel in here just so it would all be in one repo. Regardless show him some love

## Acknowledgments
Also thank you to urlhaus for providing this sample.

## Disclaimer
I am not responsible for how you choose to use this botnet, I published it for research purposes only, its always interesting to see whats being developed in terms of malware at least in the skid community. So this was for sure interesting.
